Earthdawn-Revised-Mobile
========================

This is an incomplete but runnable app meant to provide reference and filled character sheets for players while playing the Earthdawn Revised roleplaying game (made by FASA Games Inc.).  At the moment it reads race and class information from XML files and allows swiping between tabs in the Character Creator, or browsing in the Reference Library.  I may return to this project someday.
